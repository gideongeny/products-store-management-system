# Online Product Store Management System

This system is a command-line-based application allowing users to browse products, add them to their cart, and proceed to checkout.

## Features:
- **Account Creation and Login**: Users can create accounts and login to access the store.
- **Product Browsing and Cart Management**: Users can browse available products, add items to their cart, view cart details, and remove items.
- **JSON-Based Storage**: Both user accounts and products are stored in JSON files for persistence across sessions.
- **Checkout Functionality**: Users can proceed to checkout, which updates the product stock and provides the total purchase amount.

3. **Browse Products**: 
   - After logging in, you can browse available products, which are stored in the `products.json` file.
  
4. **Add to Cart**: 
   - Select products and the desired quantity to add them to your shopping cart.
  
5. **View Cart**: 
   - View the items youâ€™ve added to your cart, including the total price.
